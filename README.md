# Professional Readme Generator
## Description
This is a command line application that creates a README.md file with user input via the Inquirer package. The README is an important part of any project, acting as the first point of contact for new users. It should therefore be both high quality and consistent. The aim of this project is to enable developers to generate high quality readme files in expedited fashion, giving them more time to devote to their projects.  Developing this project, I learned a lot about importing and exporting files, file inheritance, and installing and using npm packages. It also served as good practice in building complicated strings using template literals.

## Installation
The application requires Node to use.

## Usage
In a terminal navigated to the Develop folder, use npm install to install the inquirer package. Then, run node index.js. This should prompt a series of questions to appear in the command line. Enter the answers and hit enter to move on to the next prompt.  Answers should be complete sentences. After the last prompt, a README.md file should be generated in the Develop folder for you to copy and insert into your project.
